# Mergesort In All Languages

Are you tired of unsorted arrays? Do you wanna smash your keyboard when you see the array:

> :facepunch::construction::hear_no_evil:[5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]:facepunch::construction::hear_no_evil:<br>

Well look no further!<br/>
We provide the #1 Leading Industry-Proven AI :fireworks: Decentralized :pager: Language-Agnostic :sunglasses:  Mergesort Solutions<br>

## More seriously

Our goal is to compare the length and "complexity" of the same code in many different languages. Which language is the best? Now we can know.

Functional languages like Scheme and Haskell seem to make much smaller code than Rust, Dart and C#.

And then there's [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/README), which has a 3 line solution. The jury is out if it's readable though.

## Getting started

Don't know [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).<br>
Pick up a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and try to implement it yourself
 
## Running all of the versions
 
 Install everything you need and run: `./run.sh`

## Pull Requests

 Make sure you have your language running in CI and it uses the list [5,9,1,3,4,6,6,3,2]

 New policy: We will only be fixing bugs in already submitted languages. Want to join, pick a new language!
